## Judith
- appropriation: take something else and make it your own
- Like the preying mantra
- appropriates the narrative into a more aggressive way
- lack of any seductive look
- deals with the role of women
- always self portraits
- history portrait series
- empowers herself by making her the subject
- turns the sympathies and displays female power in a different way
- no sympathy for the man
- portrayed between a parody and grotesque characature 
- poking fun at portraying women as beautiful destroyers of men

## The Swing after Fragonard
- dressed in batique fabric:
	- dutch print made to imitate local africans
	- now sold to the locals
	- money goes back to the dutch
	- part of the cultural dress, but imported and intrinsically
- we are placed in the role of the men in the original swing
- you can look right into her skirt
- both familiar and strange
- lack of a head = french revolution
- cultural hybridity
- dark skinned
- self described post colonial hybrid
- identity is a construction: placed onto us by our environment

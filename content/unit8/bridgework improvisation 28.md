- somewhat non objectivity
- loved music
- tried to make it as abstract and emotional as music
- impressions, improvisations, compositions
- pulls and stretches things to unrecognizable proportions
- style is almost completely abstract
- repeated tension of curved and flattened lines
- boat and waves
- spiritual salvation
- emotional visceral reaction
- the creative spirit is concealed behind form
- new pictorial language to strip a reliance on physical form
- abstract expressionism
